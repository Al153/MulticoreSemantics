\section{Summary of Experimental Conditions and Methods}

\subsection{Hardware}
Experiments were carried out on a HP Spectre Laptop, which was plugged in and on maximum performance settings. 

The laptop has a quad core, hyperthreaded, intel i7 8550u processor for a total of 8 physical threads (two threads per core) \footnote{https://ark.intel.com/products/122589/Intel-Core-i7-8550U-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4-00-GHz-}.

\subsection{Experimental Methods}
Experiments were written in Java and run under Windows 10. The laptop was set not to sleep for the duration of each experiment and other user processes were kept to a minimum to improve reliability of the results.

\subsection{Code Written}
The code used to run experiments and process the resulting data can be found on a dedicated Github repository\footnote{https://github.com/Al153/MulticoreSemantics}. I created an abstract \texttt{SharedArray} class containing an array with specifiable length and an abstract \texttt{sum} (read) and \texttt{update} (write) operations. Appropriate subclasses of this class were created with the \texttt{sum} and \texttt{update} operations taking the correct locks.
